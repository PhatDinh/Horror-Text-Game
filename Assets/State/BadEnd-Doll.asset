  storyText: You can't resist the urge to look so you open your eyes. Standing before
    you, no bigger than a foot tall, is the doll from the chest, only now there's
    something more evil and twisted about her face. The last thing you see are those
    pale, blue eyes gleaming with malice as the doll lunges at you with an inhuman
    scream, and the world grows dark around you.
