  storyText: There's no way you're going to let yourself get stuck in the dark with
    no light source. Before you reach for the candle and match, you decide to flip
    the doll over onto its stomach so you can't see its eyes staring blankly at you.
    Satisfied, you ignite the match with your thumb and light the candle. As you
    light it, your phone dies and the flashlight cuts out. You breathe a sigh of
    relief. Just in the nick of time, you think. You turn to exit the attic, but
    that's when you notice the writing on the wall. It looks as if someone took a
    knife and carved "DON'T LIGHT THE CANDLE. SHE'LL WAKE UP" into the wood. You
    hear the sound of jingle bells behind you, and your heart drops into your stomach.
  choiceText1: Blow out the candle
  choiceText2: Turn to look at the doll
