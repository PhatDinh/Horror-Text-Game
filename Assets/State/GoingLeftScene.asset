  storyText: "You decide to go left. You're pretty sure this is the right way. But
    as you're walking things are getting less and less familiar. Just when you're
    about to turn around, you think you hear something following you along the path
    so you decide to pick up your speed. The path leads to a clearing, and you see
    two cabins \u2013 one of them is painted baby pink and the other looks very old
    and worn. Through the windows of both cabins, you can see light which means they're
    both occupied. Maybe one of them has a landline I can use or \u2013 at the very
    least \u2013 can give me directions, you think. At any rate, you want to get
    off the path and out of the woods for a bit. Even if the thing following you
    was just in your imagination, you're still a little spooked."
