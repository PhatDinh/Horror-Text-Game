  storyText: 'You decide to shoot them a quick text, but after sending "HEY, I''M
    HERE. COULD YOU MEET ME HALF-WAY? I''M KINDA SCARED LOL," the message fails to
    send. Great. Just great, you think. That''s when you hear the snap of a twig
    behind you. You turn around, pointing your flashlight at the line of trees, but
    there''s nothing there. You''re really freaking yourself out. You''d better get
    a move on. The faster you get to the cabin, the better. When you get to a fork
    in the path, you realize that you can''t quite remember which way to go.
