  storyText: Despite the doll's best efforts, you don't look, but the temptation
    is horrible. You just need the doll's awful words to be over, but if you look,
    you know it will mean certain death. "That's ok," the doll says with its evil,
    childish voice. "Don't look. I'll just keep coming back night after night after
    night. And maybe you won't look tonight or tomorrow night. Maybe not even a month
    from now or even years. But one day, I'll wear you down, and you'll look. And
    then... on that glorious night... I'll eat your soul."
