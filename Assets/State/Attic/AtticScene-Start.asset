  storyText: 'The attic sounds like a better idea so you search the ceiling for the
    entrance. You find it in the kitchen where you pull the draw string, revealing
    the mouth of the attic and the ladder that folds down to the floor. Above your
    head, there''s only a rectangle of black. It''s just the dark, you remind yourself.
    It can''t hurt you. You begin your ascent into the attic where the only source
    of light is your quickly dying phone. You expect to see stacks upon stacks of
    dusty boxes, but to your surprise, there''s only a lone chest. Maybe there''s
    something in there I can use, you think.
