  storyText: "You decide to take your chances in the dark and return downstairs.
    Sure, the dark sucks, but you were getting some pretty bad vibes from that chest.\r\n\"Hello,\"
    a voice says from the living room, and you nearly jump out of your skin when
    you see a shadowy figure a few feet away. But then you recognize the outline
    \u2013 it's your friend.\r\n\"Oh my god, where have you been? The lights won't
    turn on, and I've been seriously freaking out!\"\r\n\"Sorry I'm so late. My head...
    hasn't felt right all evening,\" they say, and you notice something weird about
    their voice. It almost sounds... deeper than usual? The hairs on the back of
    your neck stand up, but you're not entirely sure why. Your friend takes a step
    closer, and a patch of moonlight coming in through the window illuminates their
    face. And their eyes... it's like they changed from their normal color to a strange
    yellow. And their teeth... Oh god, their teeth. Why are they so pointy?"
