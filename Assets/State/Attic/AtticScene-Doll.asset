  storyText: "You slowly turn toward the chest, but from where you're standing, you
    can't see inside. You step closer and take a peek only to have your worst fears
    confirmed \u2013 the doll is gone. From behind you, you hear the high-pitched
    sound of a child's giggle, the jingle of bells, and tiny footsteps made by little
    porcelain feet. You're about to turn toward the footsteps when you see more writing
    etched into the wall. \"DON'T LOOK\" it reads. Immediately, you crumble into
    a ball and back yourself into a corner of the attic, keeping your eyes shut tight.
    The little footsteps get closer and closer and those bells on her dress keep
    jingling until you know that the doll is right in front of you."
