  storyText: "\"No!\" you scream, refusing to open your eyes. This nightmare continues
    for hours upon hours, and the doll's voice never stops whispering those terrible
    things. Yet you stay strong, and somehow make it until morning. As the sun rises,
    the doll's voice begins to fade until you can't hear anything anymore. After
    you're sure the doll is gone, you open your eyes and see it laying on its back,
    staring at the ceiling with a blank expression. It's just a doll again. You immediately
    escape from the attic and find your friend in the kitchen.\r\n\"Where have you
    been?!\" they ask, and you tell them everything that happened last night. \"You
    must have fallen asleep and had a realistic nightmare,\" they say, and you realize
    no one will believe you. But that's ok because it's all over. Despite your plans
    to stay at the cabin for the weekend, you apologize to your friend and go home
    early.\r\nOnce you're home, you immediately jump into bed. You've never been
    so happy to be back in your room in your whole life. In fact, you stay in your
    bed all day long and as the sun's coming down, you only snuggle further into
    the covers. Just as you're about to fall asleep, you hear something in the corner
    of your room \u2013 almost like the sound of jingle bells and little porcelain
    feet hitting the floor. You sit up in bed, your heart pounding. This can't be
    real, right? you think, but you hear the bells again, only closer now. You're
    not sure how, but the doll has found you. You hide under the covers, and that's
    when you feel the doll right on the other side of the blanket, once again whispering
    those horrible, horrible things. \"Just look,\" the doll says. \"Just one quick
    peek, and this will all be over. We can be friends then.\""
