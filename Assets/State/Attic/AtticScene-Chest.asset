  storyText: "You open the chest and gasp. Inside is a porcelain doll worn ragged
    from years of neglect. It's clearly been a while since this thing had a child
    to love it. But despite all the grime and dust, you notice that the doll's eyes
    look eerily human and that there are little silver bells sewn onto her raggedy
    dress. But that's not all you find in the chest. There's also a black candle
    and \u2013 next to that \u2013 a single match. You look at your phone battery.
    It now says 1%. You'd better hurry and make a decision.\r\n"
