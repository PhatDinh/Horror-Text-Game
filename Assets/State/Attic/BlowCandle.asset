  storyText: 'You decide to blow out the candle, and for a moment, you''re swallowed
    by the darkness of the attic. But then, to your horror, the candle flickers back
    to life. You try and try again to extinguish the flame, but it keeps lighting.

    From
    behind you, you hear the high-pitched sound of a child''s giggle, the jingle
    of bells, and tiny footsteps made by little porcelain feet. You''re about to
    turn toward the footsteps when you see more writing etched into the wall. "DON''T
    LOOK" it reads. Immediately, you crumble into a ball and back yourself into a
    corner of the attic, keeping your eyes shut tight. The little footsteps get closer
    and closer and those bells on her dress keep jingling until you know that the
    doll is right in front of you.'
