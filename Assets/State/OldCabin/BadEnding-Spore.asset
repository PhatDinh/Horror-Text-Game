  storyText: 'You decide to keep your eyes down, and when the man returns with your
    glass of water, you feel proud of your self control. The man watches as you take
    a big gulp, and it feels good going down your throat. But... wait, why does it
    taste so funny?

    You look down into the cup and, to your horror, discover
    a thick, fuzzy algae coating the bottom. You spit out the water, but you know
    it''s too late. It''s already in your stomach. You can feel whatever it is moving
    around in there.

    "What is this?!" you scream at the old man, but he doesn''t
    answer. He just stands there looking at you. A sigh escapes his lips, and he
    crumbles to the floor like a pile of clothes, as if his bones just disappeared.
    You watch as tiny green spores start to pour from his orifices like spiders.
    And that''s when you finally look up.

    Covering the entire ceiling is more
    of the algae, only this stuff is pulsing as if it were living and breathing.
    And as you look up, the algae begins to shower spores on you, and they fall into
    your eyes and mouth. You try to spit them out, but they''re multiplying by the
    second until you feel them running down your throat. You try to scream, but the
    algae is taking over faster and faster. All you can see is green spores filling
    up your eyes, and that''s when everything goes dark..'
