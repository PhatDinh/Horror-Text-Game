  storyText: '"Ok, fine. So, how do I get out of here?" you ask.

    "That''s the
    thing. You can''t. You belong to the woods now," he says and starts to laugh
    wildly. You shoot him an annoyed look and get up from the table. I don''t need
    this mess right now, you think. As you exit the cabin, you can hear the man laughing
    and screaming after you, "YOU BELONG TO THE WOODS NOW!"

    You leave the two
    cabins behind and enter the woods once again, certain that you can find your
    friend''s cabin on your own. And that''s when you come across a fork in the path.
    Hmmm, which way is it again? you think.'
