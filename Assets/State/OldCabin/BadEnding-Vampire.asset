  storyText: "Despite not being able to see, you decide to make a run for it. You
    push through the cloud of bats with all your might and see that you were right
    \u2013 it is the front door! As you reach for the door knob, you feel a slight
    sting on the back of your neck but keep moving forward. This is no time to give
    up! You burst out of the cabin and run into the forest, leaving the old man and
    his bats behind. You keep running for as long as you can, wanting to put as much
    distance as possible between you and that nightmare.\r\nBy the time you finally
    slow down, you find yourself in a field at dawn. You take a deep breath, relieved
    that it's all over and watch as the sunrise marks the beginning of a new day.
    But as the sun rises higher and higher, you start to feel strange and suddenly
    the open field doesn't seem so peaceful anymore. Why does your skin feel like
    it's on fire?! Your hand moves up to your neck, and you discover that a bat had
    bitten you while you were trying to escape. But wait... does that mean I'm a....?
    you think.\r\nThe sun is almost completely up now as your hand moves to your
    mouth, and your worst fear is confirmed. Your once-normal canine teeth are now
    razor-sharp fangs. In horror, you look up at the sun one last time as it bathes
    you in light. You try to let out a scream, but the sun has already turned your
    fledgling vampire body into ashes."
