  storyText: "When you wake up, you're strapped down to a metal table in a room with
    no windows. The only source of light is coming from a dangling bulb that glows
    dimly.\r\n\"You've awoken,\" the voice of the old man says, and his figure appears
    from out of the shadows. He's even younger now, and his eyes... oh god, they're
    red.\r\n\"Where am I?\" you ask.\r\n\"You're in my basement.\"\r\n\"What are
    you going to do \u2013 kill me?\"\r\n\"Oh no, that would be such a waste. Me
    and my children... we've been so hungry. And you... well, you'll keep on producing
    blood for years and years and years if we take care of you right.\"\r\nHe goes
    to check your arm, and you see that he's got a needle inserted in the crook of
    your elbow that's connected to a tube that leads to a plastic bag full of something
    solid red... your blood.\r\n\"Yes,\" the old man says with a smile, revealing
    his set of razor-sharp fangs. \"You're going to keep us well fed for a very,
    very long time.\" You begin to scream for help, but you know deep down that no
    one will hear your cries."
