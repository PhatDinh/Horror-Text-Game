  storyText: 'Your curiosity gets the best of you, and you look up. To your horror,
    you see what looks like thousands upon thousands of little rodents hanging from
    the ceiling. You let out a scream, and that''s when you realize the old man isn''t
    in the kitchen anymore. Somehow, he''s appeared right behind you.

    "I told
    you not to look," he says with a wicked grin.

    "Why do you have rats on your

    fangs protruding from his mouth, and the hairs on the back of your neck stand
    on end. No, this can''t be real, you think. You look for an escape, but all you
    can see is the man and the bats, and... Wait, is that the front door? You can
    barely make it out, but it could be... Or it could be just another room in this
    house from hell. You...'
