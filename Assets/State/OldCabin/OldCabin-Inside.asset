    you say. The old man sighs and opens his door for you to enter.

    "Fine,
    suit yourself. C''mon in. But whatever you do... don''t look up," he says, and
    you follow him into his home. Inside, you see from the corner of your eyes that

    the floor. You fight the urge to peek. What could possibly be up there that he
    doesn''t want me to see? you think. The old man leads you to a table covered
    in dirty dishes and gestures for you to sit.
