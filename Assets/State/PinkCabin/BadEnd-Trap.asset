  storyText: "You start to make your way down the stairs into the darkness. The stairs
    creak underneath your feet, and you notice an odd smell that you can't quite
    place. As you get to the bottom of the staircase, you turn to the lady who's
    following behind you.\r\nAs soon as your eyes meet, you can tell something is
    wrong. She hits a switch on the wall, and a metal door comes crashing down between
    you and the stairs. The lights flicker on, illuminating the basement and revealing
    it for what it truly is \u2013 a cage.\r\n\"What are you doing? Let me out. Stop
    playing around,\" you say, banging your firsts against the bars.\r\n\"I tried
    all the usual pets... fish, dogs, cats. But none of them really brought me any
    satisfaction. I couldn't keep any of them alive, you see. But you\u2026 I\u2019m
    going to take very, very good care of you. Forever and ever and ever,\" she says
    smiling. She walks up the stairs, turns off the light, and closes the door behind
    her, leaving you to explore your new home all alone in the dark."
