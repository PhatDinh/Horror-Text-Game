  storyText: 'You start to walk in the direction of the pink cabin. You climb the
    porch steps and knock on the door. A sweet, old lady in a nightgown answers the
    door.

    "Hello there," she says. "Why, you look frightened half to death.
    Are you ok?"

    "Hi. I seem to be a little lost. I was looking for my friend''s
    cabin, and I got turned around, and now my phone doesn''t have any service. Do
    you think I could use your phone?"

    "I''m sorry, but I don''t have a phone.
    But I probably have an old map somewhere. I can make some tea for you to enjoy
    while I look if you''d like." You look at the other cabin. Maybe they have a
    phone, you think. On the other hand, tea does sound nice...
