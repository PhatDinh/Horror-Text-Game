  storyText: "\"Um... I actually think I should be going. I'm sure my friend's wondering
    where I am,\" you say. But as you start to turn around, you feel a hard push
    from behind and go tumbling down the staircase into the dark. Luckily, when you
    hit the basement floor, the ground isn\u2019t hard. In fact, it feels soft and
    almost like... it\u2019s moving? From the top of the staircase, the lady turns
    the lights on, and you can see why the floor feels like it's moving \u2013 the
    entire basement is filled with thousands upon thousands of snakes.\r\n\u201CThese
    are my babies!\u201D the old woman says. \"I started with just one in that empty
    terrarium you saw, but I couldn't get enough! The one draw back to having so
    many snakes is... well, they get awfully hungry!\" She closes the door, and you
    try to scream for help, but a large snake forces its way into your mouth and
    slithers down your throat and into your stomach."
