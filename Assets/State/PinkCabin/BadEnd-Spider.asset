  storyText: "\"Where am I?\" you ask. You notice a strange scuttling sound coming
    from all around.\r\n\"The basement,\" the old lady says. \"It all started with
    that terrarium, you see. I had two babies in there at first, but they kept multiplying
    and multiplying. But then my babies grew too big for that little old terrarium
    so I had to find them a new home. And the basement... well, let's just say that
    they're absolutely thriving down here.\"\r\nAt that moment, the old lady switches
    on the lights, and \u2013 to your horror \u2013 you discover the source of the
    scuttling sound. All around you, from floor to ceiling, are giant spiders. You
    open your mouth to scream, but the spiders are fast. They begin to climb down
    your throat before a single sound can escape past your lips."
