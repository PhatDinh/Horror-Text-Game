  storyText: "You wake up to the sound of running water and crickets chirping. You're
    laying on your back and feel something cold and heavy wrapped around you. You
    look down at your body and see that you've been wrapped in a set of heavy, rusted
    chains. You try to speak but your mouth has been covered with tape. With surprising
    strength, the old lady is pulling you across a dock toward the water. At the
    edge of the dock, she looks down at you and smiles.\r\n\"Please tell my son I
    said hello,\" she says and then pushes you into the water. As you sink into the
    depths of the lake, the bottom starts to come into focus, and you see something
    that makes your blood run even colder than the water you're in. It's the submerged
    skeleton of a young child \u2013 the old lady's son. And it looks like the two
    of you are going to be spending a lot of time together. As you struggle for air,
    everything starts to go black, and the last thing you see are the two holes where
    the old lady's son's eyes use to be staring back at you."
