  storyText: "\"Why are you doing this? Why are you keeping me in this cage?\" you
    ask.\r\n\"The cage isn't to keep you in, my dear. It's to keep him from getting
    out,\" she says and points just over your shoulder. \"He gets awfully hungry,
    you see.\"\r\nYou turn slowly and hear the sound of something large and terrifying
    skulking in the darkness. Then you gasp as some kind of monstrous creature with
    glowing red eyes and razor-sharp teeth crawls out of the shadows, licking its
    lips with a black tongue that's dripping with spit.\r\n\"What is that thing?!\"
    you ask as it lunges toward you, a deep growl rumbling from its snarling mouth.
    That's when you realize... it doesn\u2019t matter what the monster is or what
    it's called because, any second now, you're going to be its dinner."
