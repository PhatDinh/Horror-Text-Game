  storyText: 'I''m so sorry, but no. I really need to get in contact with my friend,"
    you say and start to walk away.

    "I''d be careful if I were you," the old
    lady says, looking up at the night sky. "It''s a full moon. And those woods...
    well, you''d better watch out. One day, many years ago, my son went into those
    woods at night, and he never came back."

    "I''ll be fine. Thanks." You walk
    away and hear the old woman lock the door behind you. You shudder as you replay
    her words in your head. Looking up, you see that she was right. It is a full
    moon. You look at the other cabin and then at the path that leads back into the
    woods. Hmmmm, you think. What should I do?'
  choiceText1: Try the other cabin
