  storyText: "You decide to go right. You're pretty sure this is the way. And \u2013
    look at that \u2013 you were correct! The cabin is just ahead, but... wait a
    second. The windows are dark. Where's your friend? You knock but no one answers.
    The front door's unlocked so you go inside and call out for your friend. There's
    no response. When you try to turn on the light, nothing happens. You take a look
    at your phone and see that it's on 6%. It's going to die any second. Hmmm, didn't
    the lights go out the last time you were here? If you remember correctly, your
    friend said there was a generator in the basement and a flashlight or some candles
    in the attic."
