  storyText: '"No thank you," you say. "I think I should just go home and rest. We
    can do this again some other night, ok?"

    that," your friend says, locking the door behind them.

    I need to get out of here," you say, looking for a way out but coming up empty.
    They have to be kidding though... right? But if that''s the case, why is your
    heart beating so quickly?

    "You''re not going anywhere," they say and pull
    a long kitchen knife out from behind them. The last thing you see is a swift
    glint of silver flash before your face, and then everything goes dark.'
