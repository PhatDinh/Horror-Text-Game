  storyText: 'Looking for the generator sounds like a good plan. As you head for
    the basement door, you remember a scary story your friend told you. It was something
    about a ghost named Bloody Mariah who had been murdered here in the basement
    years ago and that her spirit still haunts this place. And you can see the very
    spot where she had been murdered because there''s still a dark spot on the concrete
    from where her blood had pooled. But that was just a story, right? Hmm.... You
    rethink going down to the basement.
