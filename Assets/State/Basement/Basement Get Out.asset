  storyText: That's it. Things are getting too weird around here, you think. Before
    the demonic figure in the window can make another scratch with its nails, you're
    out the door and running back to your car. The trees are whirring past, some
    of the branches scratching at your face like claws, but you pay them no mind.
    You're focused on getting out of this place. You get to the fork in the road
    you had passed previously.
