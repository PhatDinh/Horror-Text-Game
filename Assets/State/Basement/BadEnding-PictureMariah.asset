  storyText: You decide to take another photo. Once again, you turn your flashlight
    off and aim it toward the spot. You click, and the flash illuminates the room
    for just a second, but in that single second, you see the haunting face of a
    blood-soaked woman right in front of your own. Before you can even scream, the
    ghost grabs your face with its pale hands and opens its mouth wide, wider than
    any mouth should ever go. It pulls you inside, and everything goes dark. Your
    friend comes to the cabin the next day because they got their dates mixed up.
    But all they find in the basement is your phone sitting in the middle of an identical
    dark spot
