  storyText: "\"Yes, that would be amazing,\" you say, and your friend walks to the
    kitchen to get started on the tea. As you wait, you remember the Ouija board.
    How was that thing moving on its own? It's probably just some sort of prank board,
    right?\r\n\"Here's your tea,\" your friend says, handing you a warm, steaming
    mug.\r\n\"Thank you,\" you say and take a sup. It tastes slightly bitter, but
    the warmth calms your nerves. \"So, how did you rig that Ouija Board to move
    on its own?\"\r\n\"I didn't do anything,\" your friend says, but they sound distant
    as if they aren't sitting right next to you. In fact, you notice the edges of
    your vision starting to blur.\r\n\"But the board... it said not the trust...
    to t-t-tru\u2013\" You realize too late that your tea was poisoned, and the Ouija
    board was right to tell you to not trust your friend. The world grows dark around
    you, and the last thing you see before blacking out is your friend's evil smile."
