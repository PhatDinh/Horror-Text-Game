  storyText: "You ignore the spot. It's just a dumb story your friend told you. Besides,
    looking for the generator is a much better use of your time. You find the generator
    on the far side of the basement. You flip the switch and pull the cord like your
    friend taught you, and the generator roars to life. As the basement lights flicker
    on, you think you see a figure of a woman by the stairs. You gasp and whip your
    head in that direction, but there's nothing\u2019s there. Just a trick of the
    light, you think. That\u2019s when you notice a dusty Ouija board on the floor."
