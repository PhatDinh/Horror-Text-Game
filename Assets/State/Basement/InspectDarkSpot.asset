  storyText: "You decide to take a look. Close up, it actually kind of looks like
    the shape of a woman, but it has to be some kind of coincidental chemical stain
    or something, right? You decide to take a photo to send to your friend. Maybe
    you'll both get a kick out of this once they get here. Your flashlight turns
    off as you open the camera, and you're swallowed by the dark. You aim your phone
    in the direction of the spot and click. As the flash goes off, you think you
    see a woman's face right in front of you. Startled, you fall backward. You quickly
    turn on your flashlight and look around the room. It's empty. When you look at
    the photo you just took, it's also empty \u2013 just a simple photo of the dark
    spot.\r\n"
