    That's when you feel something hot against the nape of your neck and the sound
    of ragged breath. Against your better judgement, you slowly turn around and find
    yourself nose to nose with the bloodied face of a dead woman, her skin rotting
    and peeling off in places. The last thing you see are a pair of dead, white eyes
    as Bloody Mariah lunges toward you so fast that you don't even have time to scream."
