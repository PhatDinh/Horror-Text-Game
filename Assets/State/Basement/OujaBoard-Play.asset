  storyText: You sit down in front of the board and use your hand to dust it off,
    revealing all the familiar letters and numbers. You don't see the harm in having
    a little fun while you wait for your friend. You don't really believe in this
    stuff anyway. You get started by laying your index and middle finger gently on
    the planchette. Almost immediately, the planchette begins to move on its own.
    You pull your hands back and watch as it circles the board.
