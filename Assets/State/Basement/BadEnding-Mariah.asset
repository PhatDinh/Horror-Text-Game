  storyText: '"Go away!" you say, and there''s an inhuman scream on the other side
    of the door. With one final bang that sounds like a crack of thunder, the door
    flies off of its hinges, and the ghost of Bloody Mariah stares down at you with
    those dead, dull eyes. The last things you can recall are a pair of hands lunging
    at your throat and the smell of decaying flesh.'
