  storyText: Nope, nope, nope! This is way too creepy for you. You run up the stairs
    and close the basement door behind you. You notice that your heart is beating
    really hard in your chest, and you laugh at yourself for letting your imagination
    get the best of you. But that's when you hear the sound of long nails scratching
    against the cabin windows. You turn toward the sound and see a figure on the
    other side of the window with long, dark hair and pale eyes.
