  storyText: '"I don''t know. I''m not sure... A lot of weird things have been happening
    tonight. I think I should just go home and rest. We can do this again some other

    locking the door behind them and then walking toward you.

    "Stop playing
    around. I need to go," you say.

    "Sorry, but you''re not going anywhere,"
    they say and pull a long kitchen knife from behind their back. The last thing
    you see is a swift glint of silver flash before your face and then everything
    goes dark around you.'
