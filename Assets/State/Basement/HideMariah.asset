  storyText: You try to let out a scream, but no sound comes out. As the figure of
    Bloody Mariah stares from behind the glass, you decide to hide so you pick the
    first door you find. It leads to a small, windowless bathroom. As soon as you
    lock the door behind you, the doorknob starts to rattle in your hand, and loud
    knocks seem to make the entire room shake.
