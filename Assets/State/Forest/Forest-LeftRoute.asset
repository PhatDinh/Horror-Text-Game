  storyText: "You take the left path and keep running with everything you've got.
    After what seems like a mile, you finally find your car and manage to climb inside.
    Through the windshield, you see the creature burst through a line of trees and
    stand in front of the car. It's on its hind legs yet its face looks almost like
    a wolf. For a moment, you wonder what this awful creature could possibly be,
    but with the full moon high overhead, you think you have a pretty good idea \u2013
    werewolf. Looking in the backseat, you see that you have a baseball bat you can
    use as a weapon, but you could also drive away."
