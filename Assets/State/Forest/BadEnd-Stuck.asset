  storyText: "Again, you start to run without even thinking. After almost a half-hour
    of running, you look down and realize you're not even on a path anymore. You
    curse at yourself but then remember your keys. You take them out of your pocket
    and click the alarm on the fob in hopes that the horn will lead you back to civilization.
    But as you press the button, the sound of your car's alarm somehow comes from
    all around. \u2013But... that's impossible,\u2013 you think. And that's when
    you realize... the woods have swallowed you whole, and you'll never escape them,
    no matter how far or fast you run."
