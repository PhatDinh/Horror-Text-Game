  storyText: You decide to take cover behind a tree and hide from the creature. Covering
    your mouth with your hand, you hope that the thing won't be able to hear your
    breathing. The beast is so close now, you can hear it growling and sniffing on
    the other side of tree. It's too late by the time you realize it can smell you.
    The towering creature begins to circle the tree, and by the looks of its face
    and gleaming yellow eyes, it's some kind of wolf. But then you realize it's standing
    on its hind legs and... wait a second. Why is it wearing the tattered remains
    of your friend's shirt? The creature stops in front of you, revealing its razor-sharp
    teeth in a snarl. In a way, the wolf creature looks familiar. But it can't possibly
    be... It lunges and starts to tear into you. As you lie dying on the forest floor,
    the last thing you hear is a blood curling howl and then everything goes dark.
