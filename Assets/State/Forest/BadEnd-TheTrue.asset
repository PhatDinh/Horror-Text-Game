  storyText: '"No!" you scream. With surprising speed, you find the door to the bathroom
    and lock yourself in. Your friend is scratching at the wood, trying to claw their
    way inside.

    "This is all your fault!" they scream, but it sounds eerily
    like a howl. "Don''t believe me? Just look in the mirror."

    This can''t
    possibly be real, you think. But when you go to the mirror and look at your reflection,
    you gasp. Your eyes are a bright yellow, and your teeth have already started
    to turn into razor-sharp fangs. Bewildered, you turn to the bathroom window to
    try and escape, but as you open the window and see the full moon high over head,
    all you can do is let out a piercing howl and let the change take over.'
