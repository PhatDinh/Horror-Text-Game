  storyText: 'You quickly lock all the doors and get the car running. With the headlights
    on the creature, it only looks more frightening and inhuman. It lets out a gigantic
    roar, and you think, I''ve got to get out of here. You hit the gas pedal with
    the intention of backing out of the parking spot, but the car lurches forward.
    You accidentally put the vehicle in drive instead of reverse! For just a moment,
    the werewolf looks like a deer in headlights, and then you hear a crunch as you
    run over its foot. It roars in agony, and you throw the car into reverse (for
    real this time). You back out of the spot and start to drive away, leaving the
    werewolf howling in your wake. You drive all the way home.

    "I thought you
    were going to your friend''s cabin," you mother says when you enter the house.

    "Had
    to cancel," you say, knowing that she''d never believe you in a million years.
    That night, you sleep better than you''ve ever slept before. You sleep so hard
    that it takes your mom several attempts to wake you.

    "Hey, sleepy head.
    Get up," she says. You open your eyes and sit up in bed.

    "What''s going
    on?" you ask.

    "Your friend came by to apologize about last night," she
    says and points to your doorway. Your friend is standing there with an apologetic
    smile on their face, but your blood runs cold when you see what''s on their leg.
    There''s a fresh cast encasing their leg, and you think you might know how they
    got it.'
