  storyText: "In that moment, it all comes flooding back to you \u2013 your terrible
    secret and the accident you had a month ago where you bit your friend. You can't
    stand it anymore... You have to get out of this cabin! And besides... you feel
    the change starting to take over.\r\nYou burst through the cabin door with an
    inhuman leap, and when you hit the ground, you're on all fours instead of on
    two legs. Now you're running faster than any human could, and the woods have
    come alive around you. You get to a small clearing and raise your fanged mouth
    to the sky. The moon looks back at you, full and bright. You let out a long,
    piercing howl, and that's when you smell something... It smells an awful lot
    like people. Your wolf ears pick up the sound of laughing. It's probably some
    campers somewhere in the woods. Perfect timing, you think, licking your lips.
    You were just beginning to get hungry."
