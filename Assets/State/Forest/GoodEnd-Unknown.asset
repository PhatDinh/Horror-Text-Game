  storyText: "When you wake up, it's morning, and there are birds singing sweetly
    in the trees. Oh my god... what a nightmare, you think. But if it was just a
    nightmare, how did you end up in the forest? Maybe you had been sleeping walking.
    Yes, that has to be it.\r\nAfter dusting yourself off, you walk through the forest
    and come across your friend's cabin. You let yourself in, and your friend is
    in the kitchen cooking breakfast.\r\n\"Where were you last night? I was worried
    about you,\" they say, their back turned as they flip something on the stove.\r\n\"You're
    not going to believe this, but I had the strangest dream\u2013\" you start, but
    then your friend turns around, and you see that they have an eyepatch on. On
    their plate is a raw piece of steak, all red and juicy. Your friend smiles, and
    their teeth look just a little bit too sharp.\r\n\"It's ok. No hard feelings,\"
    they say. \"And you don't have to be afraid. At least not right now. The next
    full moon isn't for another month.\""
