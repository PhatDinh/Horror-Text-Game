  storyText: 'Before your friend can say another word, you''re sprinting out the
    door and towards your car. Luckily, the full moon is so bright that it''s lighting
    your path. Behind you, you hear your friend screaming in agony, and you almost
    turn around. But then the scream transforms into a howl, and you decide to keep
    running. You get to a fork in the path and can''t exactly remember which way
    is the way back to the car. But you can''t hesitate. You have to choose quickly
    because you think you hear something large and fast coming your way.
