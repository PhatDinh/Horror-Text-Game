  storyText: "You decide to go right. As you're running along the path, the creature
    behind you is gaining quickly. It's too fast. There's no outrunning it. You only
    have two options.\r\n\r\nYou find a large branch on the ground and pick it up,
    wielding it like a sword. You hear the beast getting closer and closer. It burst
    through a line of trees and stands before you, almost two or three feet taller
    than you. It's on its hind legs yet its face looks almost like a wolf. You wonder
    what this awful creature could possibly be, but with the full moon high overhead,
    you think you have a pretty good idea \u2013 werewolf. It lunges at you, and
    you swing your branch with everything you've got. To your surprise, the branch
    actually hits the creature in its eye, piercing the skin. The werewolf yelps
    and claws at the hole where its eye used to be. With its tail tucked between
    its legs, it runs off whimpering. You look at the end of your branch and see
    the werewolf's eye still clinging to the end, and the sight makes you faint.
    You fall to the forest floor, and darkness takes over."
